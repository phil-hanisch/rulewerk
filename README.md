A Java library based on the [VLog rule engine](https://github.com/karmaresearch/vlog)

Installation
------------

The current release of Rulewerk is version 0.6.0. The easiest way of using the library is with Maven. Maven users must add the following dependency to the dependencies in their pom.xml file:

```
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.semanticweb.rulewerk</groupId>
	<artifactId>rulewerk-core</artifactId>
	<version>0.6.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Previous to version `0.6.0`, *rulewerk* project name was *vlog4j*. Older versions released under name *vlog4j* have `<groupId>org.semanticweb.vlog4j</groupId>` and `<artifactId>vlog4j-core</artifactId>`, the latest version being version `0.5.0`.


You need to use Java 1.8 or above. Available modules include:

* **rulewerk-core**: essential data models for rules and facts, and essential reasoner functionality
* **rulewerk-parser**: support for processing knowledge bases in [Rulewerk syntax](https://github.com/knowsys/rulewerk/wiki/Rule-syntax-grammar)
* **rulewerk-graal**: support for converting rules, facts and queries from [Graal](http://graphik-team.github.io/graal/) API objects and [DLGP](http://graphik-team.github.io/graal/doc/dlgp) files
* **rulewerk-rdf**: support for reading from RDF files in Java (not required for loading RDF directly during reasoning)
* **rulewerk-owlapi**: support for converting rules from OWL ontology, loaded with the OWL API
* **rulewerk-client**: stand-alone application that builds a [command-line client](https://github.com/knowsys/rulewerk/wiki/Standalone-client) for Rulewerk.
* **rulewerk-vlog**: support for using [VLog](https://github.com/karmaresearch/vlog) as a reasoning backend for Rulewerk.

The released packages use vlog-base, which packages system-dependent binaries for Linux, macOS, and Windows, and should work out of the box with current versions of these systems (for linux, you will need at least libstdc++-v3.4.22; for macOS, you will need at least macOS 10.14). In case of problems, or if you are using the current development version, own binaries can be compiled as follows:

* Run [build-vlog-library.sh](https://github.com/knowsys/rulewerk/blob/master/build-vlog-library.sh) or execute the commands in this file manually. This will compile a local jar file on your system, copy it to ```./rulewerk-vlog/lib/jvlog-local.jar```, and install the new jar locally in Maven in place of the distributed version of vlog-base.
* Run ```mvn install``` to test if the setup works



Documentation
-------------

* The module **rulewerk-examples** includes short example programs that demonstrate various features and use cases
* The GitHub project **[Rulewerk Example](https://github.com/knowsys/rulewerk-example)** shows how to use Rulewerk in own Maven projects and can be used as a skeleton for own projects
* [JavaDoc](https://knowsys.github.io/rulewerk/) is available online and through the Maven packages.
* A Rulewerk [Wiki](https://github.com/knowsys/rulewerk/wiki) is available online, with detailed information about rulewerk usage, the supported rule language [examples](https://github.com/knowsys/rulewerk/wiki/Rule-syntax-by-examples) and [grammar](https://github.com/knowsys/rulewerk/wiki/Rule-syntax-grammar), and related publications.

Development
-----------

* Pull requests are welcome.
* The master branch may require a development version of VLog.
Use the script `build-vlog-library.sh` to create and install it on your machine (you may need to delete previous local builds first).
* Users of Eclipse should install the javacc plugin to generate the parser sources. After installing the plugin, right-click on the file `JavaCCParser.jj` in `org.semanticweb.rulewerk.parser.javacc`, and select "compile with javacc". This step needs to be repeated when the file changes.
* We largely follow [Java Programming Style Guidelines published by Petroware](https://petroware.no/javastyle.html). The main exception are the names of private members, which do not usually end in underscores in our code.
